# What is Machine Learning?


Let's start with a classic definition. If you look up the term in a search engine, you might find something like this:

*Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends.*

Let's break that down a little. One important component of machine learning is that we are taking some data and using it to make predictions or identify important relationships. But looking for patterns in data is done in traditional data science as well.

In traditional programming, the inputs of hard-coded rules and data are used to arrive at the output of answers, but in machine learning the approach is quite different.
Data and Historical answers are input to the algorithm. Rules are the output of the algorithm.

# Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning is used to solve an extremely diverse range of problems. For your reference, here are all the examples we discussed in the video, along with links to further reading in case you are curious and want to learn more about any of them:

## Automate the recognition of disease
Trained physicians can only review and evaluate a limited volume of patients or patient images (X-rays, sonograms, etc.). Machine learning can be used to spot the disease, hence reducing physician burnout. For example, [Google has trained a deep learning model to detect breast cancer](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/03/google-computers-trained-to-detect-cancer/) and [Stanford researchers have used deep learning models to diagnose skin cancer](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/25/artificial-intelligence-used-identify-skin-cancer/).

## Recommend next best actions for individual care plans
With the mass digitization of patient data via systems that use [EMRs (Electronic Medical Records) and EHRs (Electronic Health Records)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record), machine learning can be used to help build effective individual care plans. For example, [IBM Watson Oncology](https://www.ibm.com/products/clinical-decision-support-oncology) can help clinicians explore potential treatment options. More examples of how machine learning impacts healthcare can be found [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolemartin1/2019/08/30/how-healthcare-is-using-big-data-and-ai-to-cure-disease/#64671f7e45cf).

## Enable personalized, real-time banking experiences with chatbots
You've likely encountered this when you call a customer service number. Machine learning can be used to intercept and handle common, straightforward issues through chat and messaging services, so customers can quickly and independently resolve simple issues that would otherwise have required human intervention. With the chatbot, a customer can simply type in a question and the bot engages to surface the answer. Refer to [this article](https://www.drift.com/learn/chatbot/ai-chatbots/) to find more information about chatbot powered machine learning.

## Identify the next best action for the customer
Real-time insights that incorporate machine learning tools—such as [sentiment analysis](https://www.concur.com/newsroom/article/machine-learning-with-heart-how-sentiment-analysis-can-help-your)—can help organizations assess the likelihood of a deal closing or the level of a customer’s loyalty. [Personally-tailored recommendations](https://medium.com/@madasamy/introduction-to-recommendation-systems-and-how-to-design-recommendation-system-that-resembling-the-9ac167e30e95) powered by machine learning can engage and delight customers with information and offers that are relevant to them.

## Capture, prioritize, and route service requests to the correct employee, and improve response times
A busy government organization gets innumerable service requests on an annual basis. Machine learning tools can help to capture incoming service requests, to route them to the correct employee in real-time, to refine prioritization, and improve response times.
